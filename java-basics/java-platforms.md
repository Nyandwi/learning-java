## The Difference Between Java Platforms: JDK, JRE, JVM

One of the Java advantages is that its programs can run everywhere. A program writtem for the Java platform can run well on other hardwares and operating systems. 


### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

A virtual machine is a software implementation of a given physical machine. There are numerous softwares that allow people to use a given operating system or other machines virtually. Example of virtual machines include [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox) Virtual PC, Parallels Desktop for Mac, etc...

JVM is a kind of virtual machine that allow a computer to run a Java program. JMV is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java programs. JVMs are available for many hardwares and softwares platforms, which means it does not depend on platform. 

When you execute a Java program, Java compiler convert the Java code to `bytecode`. JVM convert the `bytecode` to machine code(set of binary instructions that can be executed directly by CPU).
