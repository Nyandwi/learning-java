# Learning Java

*I am currently taking Java for mobile applications class. I am going to be using this repo as a reference for my learning and notes.* 

Java is a a high level, general purpose, class based, and powerful programming language that can run all platforms that support Java without recompilation and hence the notion `Write Once, Run Everywhere(WORA)`. 

Java programs are usually compiled to `bytecode` that ca run on any Java Virtual Machine(JVM) regardless of the underlyining platform/machine. 


***Here are some few facts about Java language:***

* Designed by [James Gosling, a.k.a Dr. Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling) and currently owned by Oracle.
* Designed in 1995
* Write once, run everywhere
* Java Syntanx are similar to C/C++/C#
* Java uses comments similar to C++: `//...This is a comment...//`, `/*...This is a comment...*/`, `/**...This is a comment...*/`.
* Java programs filename extensions: `.java`, `.class`, `.jar`. 
* Java is one of the popular programming language, most notable in backend server development
* Java is open source and free.
* Java is secure, fast, and powerful.
* Great community support(about 9 millions developers)
* Former called `Oak`, then changed to `Green`, then finally to `Java`.
* Java programms can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspiberry pie...


## Hello World 

```
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
    }
```


## Uses of Java 

Java is a cross-platform programming language. 

It is used for building: 

* Mobile applications(Android apps)
* Desktop applications
* Web applications
* Web and applications servers
* Gaming applications
* Distributed applications
* IoT(Internet of Things) Applications


## Java Philisophies

* Simple to learn, object oriented**, and familiar
* Robust and secure
* Portable and cross platform(architecture-neutral)
* Fast execution
* Interpretable(no need to compile first, just like Python)

** *Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm or style that organizes a software design around data(or objects) and well defined interfaces instead of functions and logics. Object is instance of clsss and it contains data and function.*

** *Java OOPs concepts are: Abstraction,encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The main goal of these concepts is to implement real world entities in programs.*
